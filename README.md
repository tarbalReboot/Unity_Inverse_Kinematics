# Unity_Inverse_Kinematics
Short Inverse Kinematics script for Unity3D

Often in a 3D game, characters walk or run on slopes. Dynamic colliders on feet are not practical or useful,
so inverse kinematics is often utilized to place footing appropriately. Otherwise, one foot would be in the
air, and the other would be below the surface when on a slope. Check the comments in the script to adjust 
appropriate settings in the inspector.
